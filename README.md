# NgSpotify

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.3.

This Angular 4 application will use the Spotify API to allow us to search for artists and album info and allow us to preview tracks from the application.

# Project

Utizilizing the Spotify Web API, users will be able to search for music. They can also preview the searched music.

Users can search for:

Song names and get a list of songs with the name that they searched for.

Artist and get a list of songs and albums that the artist owns.

Album and get a list of songs in that album
